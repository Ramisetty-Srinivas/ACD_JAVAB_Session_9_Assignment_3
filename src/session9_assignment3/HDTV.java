/*
 * In some situations, you may not want to change a class and make it comparable. 
 * In such cases, Comparator can be used if you want to compare objects based on certain attributes/fields. 
 * For example, 2 persons can be compared based on `height` or `age` etc. (this can not be done using comparable.)
 */

/*
 * The method required to implement is compare(). 
 * Now let's use another way to compare those TV by size. 
 * One common use of Comparator is sorting. 
 * Both Collections and Arrays classes provide a sort method which use a Comparator.
